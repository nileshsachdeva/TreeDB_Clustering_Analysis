# TreeDB_Clustering_Analysis
The file A1_TreeDB.csv contains descriptions of 258 tree species. The data was collected by the Public Tree Management division of the Open Space and Environmental Services department of the Wollongong City Council. The dataset has been provided by the Wollongong City Council as part of a collaborative project on optimal tree selection for public spaces. Clustering Analysis has been performed on the data using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms as part of an effort to develop a better understanding of the properties of the dataset. For this project, only the features (attributes) “Height”, “Width”, “Surface Area”, and “Salt” have been considered and analysed, and the datapoints have been grouped into appropriate clusters using K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms.
Both .py and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files have been uploaded for convinience.
